## Description

When you run an executable script as ./my-script.sh, the commands are run in
a new subshell, while when run as . my-script.sh the current shell context will
be used. Generally, your current context is your terminal window. This mean
that the dot command will apply changes to your current shell. Letâ€™s look at
the simple example below.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export A="hello world"
echo $A
```

When run as an executable using ./my-script.sh, the A variable is not exported in your current shell and would just return an empty result.

```
$ ./test.sh 
hello world
$ echo $A
```

When run the same script with the dot command using . my-script.sh, your current shell context will be changed.

```
$ . test.sh 
hello world
$ echo $A
hello world
```
